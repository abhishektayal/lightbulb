                               Lightbulb   

          A Git-powered, Neo4j-Backed blog engine for Heroku.


You get to write blog entries in Emacs (or your favorite editor) and use Git for version control,
without giving up the features of a dynamic app.

Write blog entries in a ReStructuredText, style them with your website's templating system. when 
you push to Heroku, the entry metadata will be automatically written to Neo4j, and the HTML 
fragment generated from the ReStructuredText source file will be served off disk.
