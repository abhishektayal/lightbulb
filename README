                               Lightbulb   

          A Git-powered, Neo4j-backed blog engine for Heroku.


You get to write blog entries in Emacs (or your favorite editor) and use Git 
for version control, without giving up the features of a dynamic app.

Write blog entries in ReStructuredText, and style them with your website's 
templating system. 

When you push to Heroku, the entry metadata will be automatically saved to 
Neo4j, and the HTML fragment generated from the ReStructuredText source file 
will be served off disk.
