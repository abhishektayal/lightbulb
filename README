          A Git-powered, Neo4j-backed blog engine for Heroku.


What is Lightbulb?

Lightbulb is a Git-powered, Neo4j-backed blog engine for Heroku written in 
Python.

You get to write blog entries in Emacs (or your favorite text editor) and use 
Git for version control, without giving up the features of a dynamic app.

Write blog entries in ReStructuredText, and style them using your website's 
templating system. 

When you push to Heroku, the entry metadata will be automatically saved to 
Neo4j, and the HTML fragment generated from the ReStructuredText source file 
will be served off disk.

What do I need?

* Neo4j Server or if you're using Heroku, the Neo4j Heroku Add On
* Python 2.7

* Bulbs 0.3 (https://github.com/espeed/bulbs)
* Beaker 1.6.2 (https://github.com/bbangert/beaker)
* Docutils 0.8 (http://docutils.sourceforge.net)

Where are the docs?
